# Student CGPA Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to predict students' CGPA based on various academic, demographic, and behavioral factors. It includes an analysis and comparison of five different models to identify the most accurate predictor. Additionally, a GUI application (`gui4.py`) allows users to input their data and receive a predicted CGPA, along with personalized suggestions for improvement. This tool aims to assist students in understanding and potentially enhancing their academic performance.

## Features

- **Model Comparison**: Analysis and comparison of five different machine learning models:
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Random Forest
  - Multilinear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **User Interface**: A Python-based GUI (`gui4.py`) that enables users to input their details and obtain a predicted CGPA.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: The GUI also provides users with actionable suggestions to help improve their CGPA.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes three types of data:
1. **Academic Data**: Information related to academic performance.
2. **Demographic Data**: Personal details such as age, gender, etc.
3. **Behavioral Data**: Information on study habits, attendance, etc.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sneha3021/student_CGPA.git
   cd sample-django-proj/student-cgpa-prediction
2.Install the necessary dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the GUI:
   python gui4.py

##Usage

Launch the GUI and input the required academic, demographic, and behavioral details.
Click the "Predict CGPA" button to get your predicted CGPA and suggestions for improvement.
